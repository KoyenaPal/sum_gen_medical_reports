You\\nhad a long hospital course and, as you are aware, was quite\\ncomplicated by a combination of your gastrointestinal bleeding\\nand the TIA that you experienced.  We performed several tests to\\nlook for the source of your gastrointestinal bleeding, including\\na \"tagged red blood cell scan,\" \"angiography,\" and 2\\ncolonoscopies.  All of these tests failed to definitively find a\\nsource.  During angiography, a suspicious area had a coil placed\\nin it which may have helped stop some of your bleeding, however,\\nits unclear if this was the main source, especially since your\\nbleeding continued afterwards.  Giving you bowel preps prior to\\ncolonscopy tended to worsen your bleeding, so we felt that\\nrepeated colonoscopies would not improve the situation.  Given\\nthat you had atrial fibrillation, the heart rhythm that gave you\\nthe TIA, it was important to keep your blood thin.  Stopping\\nanticoagulation puts you at high risk for stroke.  Thin blood\\nhowever, would lead to continued bleeding.  The only solution to\\nthis difficult situation was to give you transfusions on an\\nas-needed basis.  As a result, after discussing the benefits and\\nrisks of continued anticoagulation in the face of continued\\ngastrointestinal bleeding, we decided that we could discharge\\nyou on lovenox and coumadin with a plan coordinated by your\\nprimary care doctor to ensure your blood counts did not fall too\\nlow.

You tolerated the transfusions\\nwell. This increased need for transfusions represents decline of\\nyour bone marrow function.  You showed evidence of significant\\nimmune system dysfunction when you began to develop several\\nsores in your mouth.  The sores represent both viral and fungal\\ninfections that responded only minimally to treatment.\\n.\\nYour hospitalization was also complicated by your delicate fluid\\nstatus.  Your heart failure would cause low blood pressure which\\nwould reduce blood flow to the kidneys and ultimately cause poor\\nurine production.

This caused you to\\nhave confusion and lethargy prior to presenting to the hospital.\\n You were originally treated with intravenous hypertonic saline\\nin the medical intensive care unit. You were shortly after\\ntransferred to the medicine floor for further management.  We\\ninitially restricted your daily fluid intake, and closely\\nmonitored your serum sodium levels.  Your sodium levels improved\\nto normal during your stay.  We think that you had low sodium\\nlevels because you were drinking large amounts of water (2\\nliters/day) to prevent kidney stones, and because your\\nmedication, Hyzaar, contained hydrochlorothiazide, which is\\nknown to potentially cause low blood sodium. At home please\\nwatch what you drink and only drink 1 liter per day. A follow up\\nappointment has been made for you with urology so that they can\\ndetermine the appropriate kidney stone prevention plan. While\\nyou are in rehab, your sodium level should be checked once daily\\nfor the first week to ensure that your sodium level remains\\nnormal.\\n\\nYou were also found to have a new left lower facial droop while\\nin the hospital, which began on [**3347-8-20**] and progressed to involve\\nthe upper part of your left face as well.  You were evaluated by\\nneurology, and CT and MRI scans of your brain and neck showed no\\nevidence of stroke.  Carotid artery ultrasound and cardiac\\nechocardiogram were normal and without change. Given your\\nsymptoms and the negative head imaging, you were diagnosed with\\nBells Palsy.  Bells Palsy is a self-limited condition that is\\noften due to an unclear reason but can be due to viral or\\nbacterial infection.  It is estimated that 85% of people show\\nsigns of recovery within three weeks and 71% of people have\\ncomplete recovery. We tested your blood for herpes simplex virus\\nand Lyme disease to see if perhaps these infections caused your\\nsymptoms. These tests were pending at the time of discharge, and\\nmay be followed-up by your primary care provider as an\\noutpatient. As we await the results of these tests, we will\\nempirically treat you with Doxycycline antibiotic for presumed\\nLyme infection.  If the Lyme test returns negative, you may stop\\nthis medication. This lab result should be resulted by Tuesday\\n[**3347-8-29**], and your physician at the rehabilitation facility or\\nyour primary care provider should follow this up for you. You\\nwere started on a one week course of prednisone for the Bells\\nPalsy. Once you are out of rehab, you should see your primary\\ncare provider within two weeks so that he may assess you and\\nmanage your condition further if needed.\\n\\nIn addition, you had complained of back pain during this\\nadmission.  X-rays done of your complete spine showed only bony\\narthritic changes that are expected findings as people age. Your\\npain was likely related to a musculoskeletal strain, and\\nimproved over the time you were admitted in the hospital on\\nTylenol and a Lidocaine patch as needed.  As you also complained\\nof constipation, we placed you on a bowel medication regimen as\\noutlined below in the medication section.\\n\\nLastly, you were found to have elevated blood pressure once we\\nstopped your Hyzaar.  We continued you on Losartan, and\\nincreased your atenolol from 37.5 mg daily to 50 mg daily.\\n\\nYou were deemed medically stable for discharge to a\\nrehabilitation facility on [**3347-8-23**].
